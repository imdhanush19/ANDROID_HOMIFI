About App UI:
LOGIN PAGE
The login Page serves as the initial interface users encounter upon launching the app.
User Actions: Offers clear pathways for user engagement:	
Sign In: Allows existing users to access the app's features by logging in with their credentials, streamlining the user experience.
Automatic Navigation: Upon successful login, the app remembers user credentials, ensuring subsequent launches navigate users directly to the homepage for seamless access to content and functionality.
Forgot Password: Enables users to recover login Email-ID if forgotten, ensuring uninterrupted access to their accounts. 
Register Now: Directs new users to a signup page, facilitating account creation and entry into the app ecosystem.


REGISTER PAGE
Clicking "Register Now" in the login screen directs users to the SignUp Page.
The Register Page facilitates the registration process for new users by collecting essential information required to create an account and establish their presence within the app.
Upon accessing the Register Page, users are prompted to provide details which are mentioned in the SignUp Page.
User registration details are securely stored in Firebase Database, ensuring efficient organization and management.
This data forms the foundation for personalized experiences, user account management, and seamless app interactions.
Upon completing registration, users can seamlessly transition to the login process to access the app's features.


HOMEPAGE
Grid View of Services and Service Providers testing

The app's homepage serves as the central hub for accessing essential services, featuring six primary home service categories in a grid view  such as electrician, plumbing, beauty and spa, carpentry, and painting.

Tapping on any service category tile directs users to a list of service providers offering that particular service.

The provider listings include essential details such as their ratings and contact information (mobile number), enabling users to make informed decisions.


Profile Access:
Located in the top right corner of the homepage is the profile icon, providing users with access to their personal profile information.
Upon tapping the profile icon, users can view details of their logged-in account, enhancing user engagement and personalization.



BOOKING PAGE
Booking Process:
Upon selecting a service provider, users can proceed to the booking confirmation page by clicking the "Book" button.
The booking confirmation page prompts users to select a preferred date and time for their service appointment.
Users are presented with intuitive date and time selection interfaces, allowing them to choose their desired appointment schedule.
The "Confirm Booking" button remains disabled until users select a valid date and time for their appointment.
Only after selecting both date and time, the button becomes enabled, allowing users to proceed with confirming their booking.



BOOKING CONFIRMATION PAGE
Confirmation Page:
Upon pressing the "Confirm Booking" button, users are directed to a dedicated confirmation page displaying a tick mark symbol and the message "Booking Confirmed."
This page serves as a visual confirmation of the successful booking, reassuring users of their scheduled service appointment.
Email Notification:
Simultaneously, the app sends an email notification to the user's registered email address, confirming the booking details.
The email notification contains essential information such as the service provider's details, booked date and time, and any additional instructions or terms.
